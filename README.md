# OA

This program automates web tasks in openasset. It parses through a file containing a list of web addresses. The program then 
goes to each address, logs in, creates a backup of the database, then downloads it to the C:\cat directory which is automatically 
created. Any sites that are unreachable are logged in the Failed_URLS.log file which is created in the same directory that the program
runs in. To run the program simply double click it.
